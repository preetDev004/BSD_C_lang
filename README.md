# BSD_C_language - BTP100 Course Repository


## Overview

Welcome to the BTP100 repository! This repository contains workshops and projects completed during the Bachelors of Software Development program at Seneca College. In BTP100, I embarked on a journey to master the C programming language, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced topics. The culmination of this course was the development of a hands-on patient appointment management project.

## Course Highlights

In this course, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

- **C Language Mastery:** I learned the fundamentals of the C programming language, enabling me to write efficient and reliable code.

- **Problem Solving:** BTP100 challenged me to solve complex problems and develop algorithms to tackle real-world scenarios.

- **Project Development:** The patient appointment management project allowed me to apply my C programming skills to create a practical solution.

- **Python Automation:** Throughout the course, I leveraged Python for automating input and testing processes, streamlining my workflow and ensuring code quality.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Workshops:** This directory contains the various workshop exercises completed during the course. Each workshop focuses on different aspects of C programming and problem-solving.
