1. Were you successful in coding non-repetitive sections of logic in the game play portion of this workshop 
   (drawing of the ruler, board, player position, etc.)? If so, how did you accomplish this (don’t provide your
   code in your answer)? If not, why? Explain precisely what you struggled with and refer to the logic of the workshop
   to justify your answer.  

Ans--> Yes, i was successful in coding non-repetitive sections of logic in the game play portion of this workshop as 
       i used nested logic to do the board and ruler and user define data type to collect all the info and have the record
       of all the previos steps and what found on each step and every step all these were put in a single while loop which 
       was controlled by a flag variable.

2. Explain how the use of structures simplified your program. Provide proof of your argument by contrasting the alternatives
   – do not include code in your answer – you must explain in simple terms the impact the concept of structures has in our programming strategies.

Ans--> As structures are user define data type it allows us to group connected/similar variabes, arrays, etc. togather which
       helps to code more redable and clean and even it makes easier access to it by knowing for whom the variable is created 
       For example, here all the variables and arrays created in the structure Playerinfo identifies that they all are made for
       player.

       And if these structures were not there in this workshop it migth become hard to identify each variable for what it is created
       and also it reduces the maintainability and readability of code as all variabes are declared in chunk.

3. Examine your code and determine the maximum number of levels of nesting (deepest) you ended up using in your program logic.
   Provide a simple indented outline that illustrates your answer (copy only the construct line for each level and do not include
   all the code within unless there is another nested construct). For example, two levels of nesting as an outline:       

Ans--> The maximum number of levels of nesting i did is 4 levels.

       while(flag){
        if(movesAllowed != game.nMoves){
            for(i = 0; i < game.pathLength; i++){
                if(i == move-1){
                    for(j = 0; j <= i; j++){

                    }
                }
            }
        }
       }
