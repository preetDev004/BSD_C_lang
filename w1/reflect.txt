1. Do you have any previous programming experience? If 
   so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial 
   thoughts about the C language and this course?

Ans---> Yes, I have some coding experience which was in
   high school. Though, I have knowledge of various 
   programming languages like C, C++, Python and JavaScript 
   but I have written more lines of code in C and JavaScript 
   and that is why I am more familiar with them! 

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process 
   of a C text file into an executable program.

Ans---> In C language code is basically written in the 
   "ENGLISH" language but the computer does not understand it so
   the compiler convert this low level language into machine 
   level language which is binary/hexadecimal form and then computer
   understands the commands and executes!

3  What do you hope to achive in this course? describe 
   your goals and expectations.

Ans--->  My learning goals from this course to be proficient
   in C language and to improve logic so I can write more
   efficient code. I am expecting that this course will help me 
   in my future to learn other languages/technologies and to be a
   better developer as well.
